fixed IP address - assign an Elastic IP to your EC2 instance:
1. Go to the **EC2 Dashboard** in the AWS Management Console.
2. In the left menu, select **Elastic IPs** under "Network & Security".
3. Click **Allocate Elastic IP Address** to allocate a new IP.
4. Select the newly allocated IP, and click **Actions > Associate Elastic IP Address**.
5. Choose your EC2 instance and associate it

connect a domain to an EC2 Elastic
1. Open your domain's **hosted zone** in Route 53.
2. Create a new **A Record**.
    - Name: Enter your domain name without "www" (e.g., `example.com`).
    - Value: Enter your Elastic IP.
    - Save the record.

 load balancing:
create a **Target Group** in AWS and associate it with EC2 instances
### Steps to Create a Target Group
1. **Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard**:
    - Go to the **EC2 Dashboard**.
2. **Open the Target Groups Page**:
3. **Create a New Target Group**:
    - Click on the **Create target group** button.
    - **Choose the Target Type**:
        - Select **Instances**
    - **Define Group Details**:
        - **Target group name**: Enter a descriptive name (e.g., `nginx-target-group`).
        - **Protocol**: Select **HTTP**.
        - **Port**: Enter `80`.
        - **Health Check Protocol**: Choose **HTTP**.
        - **Health Check Path**: Enter the specific path on your Nginx server, e.g., `/` (default root path).
4. **click next and Register Targets (Add EC2 Instances)**:
    - After creating the target group, you'll need to register your EC2 instances:
        - Select the **instances** you want to add to the target group.
        - Specify the **port** (80 in this case) for each instance.
5. - Click **Include as pending below**.
6. **Finalize and Create**:
    - Click **Create target group** to finish.


- Once your **target group** is set up, you can assign it to a **Load Balancer**
To create and attach a **Load Balancer** to your target group (with your EC2 instances running on port 80)
### **Steps to Create a Load Balancer**
1. **Navigate to the Load Balancer Section**:
2. **Create a New Load Balancer**:
    - Click the **Create Load Balancer** button.
    - Choose **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** (best for HTTP/HTTPS traffic).
3. **Configure the Load Balancer**:
    - **Name**: Enter a descriptive name for your Load Balancer (e.g., `my-nginx-alb`).
    - **Scheme**: Choose one:
        - **Internet-facing** (if users access it from the internet).
    - **IP Address Type**: Stick to **IPv4** unless you need dual-stack (IPv6 and IPv4).
    - **Listeners**: By default, a listener on port **80 (HTTP)** will be created. If you also want SSL, you can add port **443 (HTTPS)** later.
    - **Availability Zones**:
        - Select the **VPC** where your EC2 instances are located.
        - Choose the **subnets** in the availability zones where your EC2 instances are running.
4. **Configure Security Groups**:
    - Create or select a security group that allows HTTP (port **80**) traffic (and HTTPS, if applicable, on port **443** later).
    - Ensure the security group permits access from the internet (for public-facing ALBs).
5. **Configure Routing**:
    - Select the target group created earlier:
        - Under **Default Action**, choose **Forward to** and select your **target group** (e.g., `nginx-target-group`).
6. **Review and Create**:
    - Review your configuration details.
    - Click **Create Load Balancer**.
### **Testing and Verifying Your Load Balancer**
- Once the load balancer is active:
    1. Locate its **DNS name** in the **Description** tab of the Load Balancer.
    2. Use the DNS name in your browser
